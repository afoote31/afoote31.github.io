In Spring 2024, I worked on a project using NFL player tracking data. Along the way, [Professor Greg Matthews](https://statsinthewild.com/) provided valuable feedback to clean up the project. The prior winter, the Kaggle NFL Big Data Bowl competition was focused on stopping the run. Tracking for every player in every play of every game of the first nine weeks of the 2022 NFL season was provided. I was late to the party and did not submit anything, but here is my project.

I was inspired by the [submission](https://www.kaggle.com/code/tindata/momentum-based-fractional-tackles) and subsequent paper by a CMU team made up of Quang Nguyen, Ruitong Jiang, Meg Ellingwood, and Ron Yurko on fractional tackles. A common measure for a defender's ability is tackles, which are assigned at the end of plays if a defender is deemed to have tackled the ball carrier. If multiple players were involved, they are each assigned half of a tackle. However, this is a very subjective measure.
