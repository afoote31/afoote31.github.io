This week, I was listening to the [Wharton Moneyball Podcast](https://open.spotify.com/show/7euXqPldw3dB4gX0HP2J5H?si=d51bd39ac5854adf), a podcast hosted by statistics professors who discuss statistics in sports. Professor [Adi Wyner](https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/profile/ajw/) and one of his graduate student collaborators, [Jonathan Pipping](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jdpipping/), mentioned their [research from NESSIS 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0-GQnOtSkI) on win probabilities. While they focused on blown leads, it got me thinking about how different leads might compare in different sports. I want to explore that in this blog post.

#### Basic Setup:
- Data of game scores at minute-level
- Who wins
- Win probabilities, conditional on lead and time remaining for different sports
- Line charts are interesting, might want to explore resampling to get estimates of variability


### Soccer
- Data from lots of leagues
- Reference StatsBomb
